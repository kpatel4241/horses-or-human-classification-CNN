# Horses-or-Human-Classification-CNN

Task
=====

In this project we are going to build a model using tensorflow.keras API that classifies weather it's a Human or Horse. Here we use CNN concept along with the augmentation of the dataset in order to make our model more efficient and easy to learn the features for good classification.

Data
=====
Horses or Humans is a dataset of 300Ã—300 images, created by Laurence Moroney, that is licensed CC-By-2.0 for anybody to use in learning or testing computer vision algorithms.

The set contains 500 rendered images of various species of horse in various poses in various locations. It also contains 527 rendered images of humans in various poses and locations. Emphasis has been taken to ensure diversity of humans, and to that end there are both men and women as well as Asian, Black, South Asian and Caucasians present in the training set. The validation set adds 6 different figures of different gender, race and pose to ensure breadth of data.
